    <h3>Report a Missing Person</h3>
  </div>
  <!-- Erica's code ends here -->

  <div class="container">
    <p>If you believe that someone is missing then please contact your local police station. Dial 101 and inform them you would like to make a missing persons report, alternatively you can attend your local police station. It is a common belief that you
      have to wait 24 hours before reporting but this is not true, you can make a report to the police as soon as you think a person is missing.</p>

    <p>If you are extremely concerned for the welfare of the person then dial 999 and ask for the police. People who are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired can text 999.</p>

    <p>The Missing Persons Ghana does not take missing person reports.</p>

    <p>The following factsheet has been written for the families and friends of missing persons. It provides further advice on what to do when someone goes missing.</p>
