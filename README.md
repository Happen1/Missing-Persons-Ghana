## About Us
Missing Persons Ghana exists to serve as a central place or helpline where families can provide information on missing persons, to support the work of the police in the investigations of missing persons and to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence; natural or man-made disaster; migration and in other situations of humanitarian need.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to reduce the incidence and impact of missing persons and to educate the Ghanaian community about this significant issue.

Also aims to support the families of missing persons to rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being.
